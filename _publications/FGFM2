excerpt: 'Motivated by the modeling of the spatial structure of the velocity field of three-dimensional turbulent flows, and the phenomenology of cascade phenomena, a linear dynamics was recently proposed that can generate high velocity gradients from a smooth-in-space forcing term. It is based on a linear partial differential equation stirred by an additive random forcing term that is ùõø-correlated in time. The underlying proposed deterministic mechanism corresponds to a transport in Fourier space that aims to transfer energy injected at large scales towards small scales. The key role of the random forcing is to realize these transfers in a statistically homogeneous way. Whereas at finite times and positive viscosity the solutions are smooth, a loss of regularity is observed for the statistically stationary state in the inviscid limit. We present here simulations, based on finite volume methods in the Fourier domain and a splitting method in time, which are more accurate than the pseudospectral simulations. We show that our algorithm is able to reproduce accurately the expected local and statistical structure of the predicted solutions. We conduct numerical simulations in one, two, and three spatial dimensions, and we display the solutions both in physical and Fourier space. We additionally display key statistical quantities such as second-order structure functions and power spectral densities at various viscosities.'
